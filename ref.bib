@ARTICLE{Carmichael2013-wq,
  title     = "Diffusion tensor smoothing through weighted Karcher means",
  author    = "Carmichael, Owen and Chen, Jun and Paul, Debashis and Peng, Jie",
  abstract  = "Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quantifies the
               spatial distribution of water Diffusion at each voxel on a
               regular grid of locations in a biological specimen by Diffusion
               tensors- 3 $\times$ 3 positive definite matrices. Removal of
               noise from DTI is an important problem due to the high
               scientific relevance of DTI and relatively low signal to noise
               ratio it provides. Leading approaches to this problem amount to
               estimation of weighted Karcher means of Diffusion tensors within
               spatial neighborhoods, under various metrics imposed on the
               space of tensors. However, it is unclear how the behavior of
               these estimators varies with the magnitude of DTI sensor noise
               (the noise resulting from the thermal e!ects of MRI scanning) as
               well as the geometric structure of the underlying Diffusion
               tensor neighborhoods. In this paper, we combine theoretical
               analysis, empirical analysis of simulated DTI data, and
               empirical analysis of real DTI scans to compare the noise
               removal performance of three kernel-based DTI smoothers that are
               based on Euclidean, log-Euclidean, and affine-invariant metrics.
               The results suggest, contrary to conventional wisdom, that
               imposing a simplistic Euclidean metric may in fact provide
               comparable or superior noise removal, especially in relatively
               unstructured regions and/or in the presence of moderate to high
               levels of sensor noise. On the contrary, log-Euclidean and
               affine-invariant metrics may lead to better noise removal in
               highly structured anatomical regions, especially when the sensor
               noise is of low magnitude. These findings emphasize the
               importance of considering the interplay of sensor noise
               magnitude and tensor field geometric structure when assessing
               Diffusion tensor smoothing options. They also point to the
               necessity for continued development of smoothing methods that
               perform well across a large range of scenarios.",
